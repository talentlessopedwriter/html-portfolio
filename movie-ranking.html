<h2>Top 3 movies. Unlikely to be subject to change</h2>

<hr/>

<h3>Kung Fu Hustle</h3>
<p>The closest to real life anime live action can get.</p>

<h3>12 Angry Men</h3>
<p>Banger film. Proof that words ARE action.</p>

<h3>Who Killed Captain Alex?</h3>
<p>Anything less than universal acclaim for this movie is invalid.</p>
